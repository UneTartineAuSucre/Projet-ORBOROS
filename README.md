# 🌌 ORBOROS Project – Genesis of the Memetic Worlds

> *A Minecraft mod that transforms the game world into a living, symbolic reflection of human behavior.*

## 🧠 The Concept

**ORBOROS** is a visionary Minecraft mod (built with [MCreator](https://mcreator.net)) that simulates the rise and fall of a civilization based on the player's behavior. Every action you take is interpreted as a **symbolic memetic value**, dynamically shaping:

- The world's generation
- Mob behavior and evolution
- Structures and biomes
- Weather, music, and ambient narrative

Each world becomes a mirror of your unconscious narrative, turning Minecraft into a symbolic life simulator.

## 🌐 Symbolic Logic

| In-Game Action         | Symbolic Meaning     | World Impact                          |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Mining aggressively    | Exploitation          | Deforestation, polluted lands          |
| Killing passive mobs   | Sacrifice, violence   | NPC fear, karmic curses                |
| Exploring far & wide   | Expansion, detachment | Lonely biomes, ancient ruins           |
| Doing nothing          | Spirituality, reflection | Mystical structures emerge          |

The game evolves with you — emotionally, thematically, and symbolically.

## 🛠️ Tools & Approach

- 🧱 Made entirely with **MCreator** (no custom Java code)
- 🧠 Uses global NBT variables to track symbolic values
- 🔁 Real-time adaptation of the world via procedural logic
- 🌌 Philosophical gameplay through systems, not stories

## 👤 Who I Am

Hi! I'm the original **idea creator**, but I have **zero coding experience**.

This project is open to **any developer, designer, or thinker** who wants to bring this symbolic system to life.  
I will not code, but I will:
- Share the full vision
- Help design meaning systems
- Test the mod as a beta player when it's playable

> I fully release this idea to the community, open-source and free. If you build it, I will play it.

## 💌 Want to Reach Out?

I’m not looking for people to work *for me* or *with me* — this idea is yours as much as mine.  
But **if you're interested**, and you’re skilled in:
- MCreator
- Minecraft modding (logic, textures, procedures)
- Symbolic systems and abstract game design

Feel free to contact me directly:
📧 **khalyel02@gmail.com**

I speak **French**, but if you’re **English-speaking and really passionate**, I’d be happy to talk too!

# 🗺️ ORBOROS – Modular Development Roadmap

This document outlines the core systems needed to bring the ORBOROS mod to life.  
Each module can be tackled independently by contributors.

---

## ✅ Core Systems

- [ ] 🔧 **Global NBT Variable System** – Stores symbolic values and updates them with player actions.
- [ ] 📊 **Debug Interface** – Displays current symbolic values for testing and tuning.
- [ ] 🧠 **Symbolic Weight Engine** – Translates actions into symbolic scores (e.g. +Violence, +Spirituality).

---

## 🌍 Adaptive World Generation

- [ ] 🌳 **Natural Structures** – Generated based on symbolic values like "Nature" or "Pollution".
- [ ] 🏛️ **Cultural Structures** – Appear depending on thresholds like "Consciousness" or "Memory".
- [ ] 🌋 **Biomes & Climate** – Change based on balance between "Technology" and "Spirituality".

---

## 🧬 Entity Behavior

- [ ] 🐺 **Evolving NPCs** – Mobs evolve or regress based on global symbolic states.
- [ ] 👻 **Symbolic Spirits** – Non-hostile mystical entities spawn as spiritual markers.
- [ ] 🧠 **Mob AI Mutation** – Mobs react differently depending on the player's karmic profile.

---

## 🎵 Atmosphere & Narrative

- [ ] 🎶 **Dynamic Soundtrack System** – Peaceful music in balance, intense music in conflict.
- [ ] 📝 **Auto-Narratives** – Generate lore, poems, or dreams based on player behavior.
- [ ] 📖 **“Book of Symbols”** – An in-game book that evolves to reflect the world’s symbolic state.

---

## 🔬 Testing & Balancing

- [ ] 🧪 **World Test Mode** – Max out symbolic values and observe world responses.
- [ ] 🧪 **God Mode Toggle** – Force symbolic values manually for quick debugging.
- [ ] 🔄 **Symbolic Reset Function** – Lets players restart their symbolic “karma”.

---

## ✨ Bonus Concepts

- [ ] 🌐 **Multiplayer Symbol Web** – Each player influences a unique “layer” of the world.
- [ ] 🧙 **Player Symbolic Archetypes** – Random symbolic roles at world spawn (“Explorer”, “Guardian”, etc.).
- [ ] 🧩 **Mod Compatibility Hooks** – Tie in with external mods via symbolic systems.

**Each item here can be picked up as a standalone task.  
If one speaks to you, go for it.**  
This project is about creativity, experimentation, and redefining gameplay meaning.

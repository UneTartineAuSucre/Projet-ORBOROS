# ⚙️ How the Symbolic System Works

The symbolic system tracks hidden "memetic" values, such as:

- ⚔️ Violence
- 🧘 Spirituality
- 🔥 Destruction
- 🌱 Nature
- 📚 Memory
- ⚙️ Technology

Each action the player takes affects one or more of these values.  
When certain thresholds are reached, the game world changes dynamically.

These values are stored in NBT data and affect generation, mob behavior, music, and more.

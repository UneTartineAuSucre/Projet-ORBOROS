# ðŸ§  ORBOROS â€“ Symbolic System Wiki

Welcome to the ORBOROS mod symbolic system wiki.  
This documentation explains the invisible symbolic layer that powers world evolution.

Every action by the player is interpreted through a symbolic lens.  
These values are stored, evolve, and reshape the world.

This mod isn't just survival or building â€” it's behavioral storytelling.
